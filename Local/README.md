The local folder is where files specific to a certain Kontrol device are located. These files are generated or created by Kontrol and are unique to each remote controller. These files are copied and saved each time Kontrol updates itself. The content of this folder is thus passed from versions to versions locally.

It contains profile settings, all the configuration of every BrSpand cards seen by the specific Kontrol device, the generic drivers downloaded for any BrSpand cards that were ever connected to this specific Kontrol remote controller and so on. You can see it as a "temp" folder.
