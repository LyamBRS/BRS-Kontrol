# Contributing
As of now, contributions are disabled. 
You are free to fork the project and develop your own version of it as you wish. 
Please take note that the content of this repository is probably not up to standards of the industry and is not meant as professional in any ways.
If you have suggestions, please leave them in #suggestions in the BRS Discord server and I will look at them guaranteed.
Please take note that this project is made on a 12 weeks period where an entire PCB and hardware needs to be made on top of this application. Kontrol's GUI is not necessary for the completion and the grade received thus is not perfected as much as it should be. Feel free to fork and improve it.
